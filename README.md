# TifToPng
Simple c# console app that converts a provided tif file to a png file.

# Usage
TifToPng path/to/file.tif

# Details
It will try to make a png at path/to/file.png . I made this very quickly to convert the files on my own rather than rely on an 3rd party service. Only converts a single file at a time.
